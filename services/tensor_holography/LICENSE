By downloading and using the Software, End User agrees to be bound by the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.

Evaluation & Testing Use Only Software Use Agreement

The Tensor Holography Software (“Software”) enables the creation of real-time, photorealistic
3D holography using deep learning. The Software consists of a large-scale 3D hologram
dataset with 4000 RGB-D images and paired 3D computer generated holograms (CGHs). Using
this photorealistic training dataset, a deep learning-based rendering system uses a 
convolution neural network to transform RGB-D input to a 3D hologram. The Software is being 
distributed for free, by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”), to the End User 
solely for review, testing and evaluation use.

Absent your agreement to the terms below (the “Agreement”), you (the “End User”) have no
right to access or use the Software whatsoever.

MIT agrees to grant, hereunder, a non-exclusive license to End User for the use of the 
Software solely for End User’s review, testing, and/or internal evaluation, at End User’s 
institution or company on the following terms and conditions:
